# recipe-api
A REST API that can manage recipes that supports retrieve all, create, retrieve, modify and delete operations.

The solution can be run in a docker container. 
However, for simplicity of local development compose.yaml for docker-compose util is provided.

The server restarts on change in `src/` directory on a host machine in case of using provided `compose.yaml` file.

## Prerequisites

- Docker desktop or Docker + Docker-compose are installed

## Quick start

Clone a project and run the commands below:
```bash
cd recipe-api
mv env.template .env
docker-compose up -d
```

Go to http://localhost:8000/docs to try the API on.
```bash
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Cleaning up
Run this command in the root of the repo:
```bash
docker-compose down --rmi local -v
```

## Description

Some nested pydantic models of `recipe` are unfinished because it is time-consuming.
Pagination for retrieving all recipes omitted for the same reason.

MongoDB is used in a project as persistent layer.
Optionally, you can browse a MongoDB itself at http://localhost:8081
```bash
open http://localhost:8081
```
